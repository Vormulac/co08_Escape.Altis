Stuff to do:


New Surprises:

	1) Search Drone
		A quadcopter than buzzes around looking for the players

	2) Crashed Friendly Aircraft
		A wrecked BluFor aircraft that has Blufor weapons around it.

	3) Friendly FIA camp
		Small camp guarded by a squad of friendly FIA.  Supplies are
		here available.

	4) Drone Strike
		Predator does a flyby and shoots at the players.

	5) Stomper Attack
		Stomper drone attacks the players


Other things:

	1) patrol boats
		Add Patrol boats to some of the bays and inlets

	2) Fighters
		If the players get a chopper and fly too high send in a fighter or two to
		fix this problem.

	3) Attack Chopper
		If the players get too far from the island then attack choppers will spawn
		and hunt them down.
		
Technical Things:

	1) Headless Client architecture
		- Separating the calls for AI scripts from other scripts.
		- Triggers and activators related to AI must be grouped with AI controlling/creating scripts
		- Adding a function to detect a HeadlessClient and make him call the related scripts.
		- Idea: Writing a remote call function. If global HC var is enabled, the script is called on HC, othervice called local on server
